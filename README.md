# open-gruv
open source teenage-engineering-op-1-like portable groovebox powered by a teensy

# op-1
how much is an op-1\
it's 1299 dollars\
can you afford it?\
i can't

# the open gruv
powered by a teensy 4.1\
sgtl5000 16-bit 44.1kHz CD-quality audio stereo codec\
2 octaves of velocity/pressure sensitive keys\
lcd display\
5 rotary encoders

# how much does it cost
targeted to around 150 dollars

# no proprietary components
except some 3d printed parts and hand cut panels and custom pcb, other components will not be proprietary\
including the velocity sensitive keys...

# the keys
the velocity/pressure sensitive keys will probably have cherry linear grey switch (linear and really stiff, maybe low profile) as the main structure and have hall effect sensors to measure the pressure\
other keys might be low profile browns

# the screen
no oled, but we do have ips lcd\
touch capability is not a necessity, but it would be nice to have.\
but unfortunately capacitive ones are harder to get and modules costs pretty much...\
3.5 inch 480\*320 is what i am looking for, but smaller and lower-res lcd panels will do just fine, with more support from teensy (320\*240 ILI9341 lcds)

# audio codec
16 bit and 44.1kHz... that is not very pro-ish\
no, it is enough, 96kHz support may come

# when will it come
not yet
