# GRUV -- An open source teensy powered groovebox

## What is Gruv
Gruv is a project that I have wanted to make quite a while ago, inspired by the Teenage Engineering OP-1. The OP-1 is well engineered and powerful, but it comes with a $1299 price tag, which I can not justify spending as I don't do music at all. 

But I didn't *just* want to have an OP-1, I just want to come up with an interesting project, a project that can improve my skills, and have fun while learning. After watching OP-1 videos on the Internet, I have come up with an idea, make an OP-1 myself. This project requires basic electronics, PCB designing, SMD soldering, programming and digital audio processing.
